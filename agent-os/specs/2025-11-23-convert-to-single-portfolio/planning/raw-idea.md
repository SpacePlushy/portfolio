# Raw Feature Idea

## Feature Description

Remove the dual-portfolio structure from the website and convert it to a single Software Engineer portfolio. This involves:

1. Remove the customer service portfolio path entirely
2. Delete the portfolio picker/selection landing page (currently at index)
3. Make the Software Engineer portfolio the primary/only portfolio (move it to index or make it the default landing page)
4. Update all navigation and routing to reflect the single portfolio structure
5. Clean up all customer service-related data, components, and content
6. Ensure the Software Engineer portfolio uses new/updated resume information

## Current Structure

The current structure has:

- A picker page that lets users choose between "Customer Service Representative" or "Software Engineer" portfolios
- Separate routes: `/customer-service.astro` and `/software-engineer.astro`
- This needs to become a single, unified Software Engineer portfolio

## Expected Outcome

A streamlined, single-purpose portfolio website focused exclusively on Software Engineer positioning, with the Software Engineer content as the primary landing experience.
