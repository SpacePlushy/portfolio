    "interviewTalkingPoints": {
      "honeywellExperience": "I worked at Honeywell Aerospace for 6 years supporting test equipment validation for NASA programs. My official title was Software Engineer, but Honeywell uses that title broadly - my specific role was test equipment support and validation. I administered Linux test systems, developed Python validation scripts including a checksum verification tool that improved efficiency by 40%, and maintained test infrastructure with 99% uptime. I executed validation procedures, troubleshot technical issues, and collaborated with engineering teams. While it had an engineering title, the work was validation and systems-focused, which is why I'm now looking to formalize those skills in a dedicated QA engineering role.",

      "whyQA": "I've been doing validation work for 6 years at Honeywell - executing test procedures, validating system configurations, troubleshooting failures, and developing automation tools. I realized my strength and interest is in the quality assurance side of engineering rather than primary software development. I want to formalize that validation expertise in a dedicated QA role where systematic testing and quality focus are the core function.",

      "testAutomation": "I have Python scripting experience from developing validation tools at Honeywell and test scripts during my internship at Performance Software. I'm familiar with the fundamentals and have created automation that improved efficiency by 38-40%. I'm actively expanding my expertise in modern testing frameworks like pytest and am confident I can quickly pick up the specific tools and frameworks your team uses.",

      "backgroundCheckNote": "If asked about title discrepancy: 'My official title at Honeywell was Software Engineer I promoted to Software Engineer II. On my resume I simplified it to Software Engineer with clarification about the test equipment support focus, since the level numbers are company-specific. The work I described is exactly what I did - validation, testing, and infrastructure support.'"
    },

    "resumeStrategy": {
      "titleChoice": "Using 'Software Engineer (Test Equipment Support)' instead of 'Software Engineer II (Test Equipment Support)' because level numbers are company-specific and meaningless outside Honeywell. Research shows dropping level numbers is recommended practice and prevents overqualified concerns for entry-level applications.",

      "backgroundCheckSafety": "Background check will show 'Software Engineer II' but resume shows 'Software Engineer' - this is the SAFE direction (understating rather than inflating). Research confirms this is not problematic.",

      "versatility": "'Software Engineer' without level number works for both entry-level ($50-60k) and mid-level ($65-75k) applications. The 6 years experience and bullets do the actual positioning work."
