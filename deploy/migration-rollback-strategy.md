# Migration and Rollback Strategy

## Overview

This document outlines the comprehensive strategy for migrating from the current "bandaid fixes" to the proper implementation with zero-downtime deployment capabilities and robust rollback procedures.

## Current State Analysis

### Existing Bandaid Fixes
- Manual health check implementations without proper lifecycle management
- Basic rate limiting without comprehensive monitoring
- Simple Docker deployment without startup sequence management
- Limited observability and alerting

### Target State
- Comprehensive application lifecycle management with proper startup sequencing
- Advanced monitoring with Prometheus metrics and Grafana dashboards
- Zero-downtime deployments with automated rollback capabilities
- Enhanced security with comprehensive rate limiting and bot protection

## Migration Strategy

### Phase 1: Foundation Setup (Week 1)
**Objective**: Establish monitoring and deployment infrastructure

#### Tasks:
1. **Deploy New Monitoring Stack**
   - Enable Prometheus metrics collection
   - Configure Grafana dashboards
   - Set up alert manager with notification channels

2. **Update CI/CD Pipeline**
   - Deploy the new GitHub Actions workflow
   - Configure deployment validation gates
   - Set up automatic rollback triggers

3. **Environment Configuration**
   - Add new environment variables for feature flags
   - Configure monitoring endpoints
   - Set up graceful shutdown handling

#### Risk Mitigation:
- Run new monitoring alongside existing systems
- Feature flags allow gradual enablement
- Existing health checks remain as fallback

#### Rollback Plan:
```bash
# Disable new features via environment variables
kubectl set env deployment/portfolio-web ENABLE_MONITORING=false
kubectl set env deployment/portfolio-web FEATURE_PERFORMANCE_MONITORING=false

# Revert to previous Docker image
kubectl set image deployment/portfolio-web app=portfolio:previous-stable
```

### Phase 2: Application Lifecycle Integration (Week 2)
**Objective**: Implement proper startup and shutdown handling

#### Tasks:
1. **Deploy Enhanced Startup Script**
   - Implement the new `start-server.js` with lifecycle management
   - Add dependency initialization sequencing
   - Configure health check coordination

2. **Update Health Check Endpoints**
   - Migrate from basic health checks to comprehensive monitoring
   - Implement readiness vs liveness probe separation
   - Add performance metrics collection

3. **Graceful Shutdown Implementation**
   - Add SIGTERM handling for clean shutdowns
   - Implement connection draining
   - Configure timeout-based forced shutdown

#### Risk Mitigation:
- Deploy with feature flags disabled initially
- Monitor startup times and success rates
- Keep fallback to simple health checks

#### Rollback Plan:
```bash
# Revert Dockerfile changes
git checkout HEAD~1 -- Dockerfile
docker build -t portfolio:rollback .
kubectl set image deployment/portfolio-web app=portfolio:rollback

# Disable lifecycle features
kubectl set env deployment/portfolio-web ENABLE_GRACEFUL_SHUTDOWN=false
```

### Phase 3: Advanced Monitoring and Alerting (Week 3)
**Objective**: Enable comprehensive observability

#### Tasks:
1. **Enable Prometheus Metrics**
   - Activate metrics collection endpoints
   - Configure custom business metrics
   - Set up performance tracking

2. **Deploy Grafana Dashboards**
   - Import pre-configured dashboards
   - Set up real-time monitoring views
   - Configure alerting rules

3. **Notification Integration**
   - Configure Slack/email notifications
   - Set up escalation policies
   - Test alert firing and resolution

#### Risk Mitigation:
- Monitor impact on application performance
- Gradual rollout of metrics collection
- Separate monitoring stack for isolation

#### Rollback Plan:
```bash
# Disable metrics collection
kubectl set env deployment/portfolio-web ENABLE_PROMETHEUS_METRICS=false

# Scale down monitoring components
kubectl scale deployment prometheus --replicas=0
kubectl scale deployment grafana --replicas=0
```

### Phase 4: Zero-Downtime Deployment (Week 4)
**Objective**: Implement production-ready deployment pipeline

#### Tasks:
1. **Enable Blue-Green Deployment**
   - Configure deployment strategy in Digital Ocean
   - Implement health check validation
   - Set up automatic traffic switching

2. **Performance Validation**
   - Add performance budgets to CI/CD
   - Implement load testing in pipeline
   - Configure automatic rollback triggers

3. **Security Enhancements**
   - Enable comprehensive security scanning
   - Add vulnerability assessment to pipeline
   - Configure sensitive data detection

#### Risk Mitigation:
- Test deployment pipeline in staging first
- Gradual rollout of new deployment features
- Manual approval gates for production

#### Rollback Plan:
```bash
# Revert to standard deployment
doctl apps update $APP_ID --spec .do/app-simple.yaml

# Disable deployment validation
# Remove performance budgets from pipeline
```

## Rollback Procedures

### Automatic Rollback Triggers

1. **Health Check Failures**
   - Consecutive health check failures (3+ in 5 minutes)
   - Response time degradation (>5s for 3 consecutive requests)
   - Error rate spike (>5% for 3 minutes)

2. **Performance Degradation**
   - Memory usage >90% for 5 minutes
   - CPU usage >85% for 10 minutes
   - Disk space <10% remaining

3. **Security Issues**
   - Multiple rate limiting triggers
   - Suspicious activity detection
   - Vulnerability scan failures

### Manual Rollback Process

#### Emergency Rollback (< 5 minutes)
```bash
# 1. Immediate rollback to last known good deployment
./deploy/scripts/emergency-rollback.sh production

# 2. Disable problematic features
kubectl patch deployment portfolio-web -p '{"spec":{"template":{"spec":{"containers":[{"name":"app","env":[{"name":"ENABLE_NEW_FEATURES","value":"false"}]}]}}}}'

# 3. Scale down if necessary
kubectl scale deployment portfolio-web --replicas=1
```

#### Planned Rollback (< 30 minutes)
```bash
# 1. Create maintenance window
./deploy/scripts/maintenance-mode.sh enable

# 2. Drain connections gracefully
kubectl patch service portfolio-web -p '{"spec":{"selector":{"version":"stable"}}}'

# 3. Deploy previous version
./deploy/scripts/zero-downtime-deploy.sh production previous-stable

# 4. Validate rollback
./deploy/scripts/validate-deployment.sh production

# 5. Exit maintenance mode
./deploy/scripts/maintenance-mode.sh disable
```

### Rollback Validation

#### Health Check Validation
```bash
# Validate core functionality
curl -f $APP_URL/api/health
curl -f $APP_URL/api/readiness
curl -f $APP_URL/

# Check response times
curl -w "%{time_total}" -o /dev/null -s $APP_URL/
```

#### Performance Validation
```bash
# Run performance test suite
npm run test:performance:production

# Monitor resource usage
kubectl top pods -l app=portfolio-web

# Check error rates
curl -s $APP_URL/metrics | grep error_rate
```

## Data Backup and Recovery

### Pre-Migration Backup
```bash
# Backup current configuration
doctl apps spec get $APP_ID > backup/app-spec-$(date +%Y%m%d).yaml

# Backup environment variables
doctl apps list-deployments $APP_ID --format ID,Phase,CreatedAt > backup/deployments-$(date +%Y%m%d).txt

# Export monitoring data (if applicable)
curl -G $PROMETHEUS_URL/api/v1/export > backup/metrics-$(date +%Y%m%d).json
```

### Recovery Procedures
```bash
# Restore from backup
doctl apps update $APP_ID --spec backup/app-spec-YYYYMMDD.yaml

# Verify restoration
doctl apps get $APP_ID --format Name,Phase,UpdatedAt
```

## Monitoring and Alerting During Migration

### Key Metrics to Monitor
1. **Application Health**
   - Response time (target: <2s)
   - Error rate (target: <1%)
   - Uptime (target: >99.9%)

2. **Infrastructure Health**
   - CPU usage (alert: >80%)
   - Memory usage (alert: >85%)
   - Disk usage (alert: >90%)

3. **Business Metrics**
   - Page load success rate
   - Image optimization performance
   - User session duration

### Alert Escalation
1. **Level 1**: Automated resolution attempts
2. **Level 2**: Development team notification
3. **Level 3**: Emergency rollback initiation
4. **Level 4**: Manual intervention required

## Post-Migration Validation
