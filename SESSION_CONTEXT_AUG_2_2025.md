# Session Context - August 2, 2025

## What We Did Today

### Problem
The portfolio website deployed to Digital Ocean was showing only plain text without any CSS styling. The issue was that static assets (CSS/JS files) weren't being served properly in production.

### Root Cause
Astro's Node.js adapter (`@astrojs/node`) expects a reverse proxy (like nginx) to serve static files from the `dist/client` directory. Digital Ocean App Platform doesn't provide this by default, so the `/_astro/*.css` files were returning 404 errors.

### Solution Implemented
Created a custom Express server (`server.js`) that:
1. Serves static assets from `dist/client/_astro` 
2. Serves public files (favicon, manifest, etc.)
3. Passes all other requests to Astro's SSR handler

### Files Changed
1. **Created `server.js`** - Custom Express server for static assets
2. **Modified `package.json`** - Changed start script to use server.js
3. **Updated `Dockerfile`** - Added public directory and server.js to build
4. **Modified `.do/app.yaml`** - Removed conflicting static_sites configuration
5. **Added dependencies** - express@^5.1.0 and @testing-library/dom@^10.4.1

### Current Status
- ✅ Website is fully deployed and operational
- ✅ CSS is loading correctly
- ✅ All static assets are being served
- ✅ Live at: https://portfolio-ph867.ondigitalocean.app

## How to Resume Development

### If CSS Stops Loading Again
1. Check that `server.js` exists and includes Express static middleware
2. Verify the build includes `dist/client` directory
3. Check Digital Ocean logs: `doctl apps logs <app-id> --type run`

### Key Commands
```bash
# Local development
npm run dev

# Build for production
npm run build

# Test production locally
npm start  # This now runs server.js, not the raw Astro entry

# Check Digital Ocean deployment
doctl apps list
doctl apps list-deployments e1992ec7-589d-433b-a8f9-f10a30f4d242
```

### Important Notes
1. **Branch**: All fixes are on `build-fixes` branch
2. **Auto-deploy**: Pushing to `build-fixes` triggers Digital Ocean deployment
3. **Memory limits**: Configured for 0.5GB instances (basic-xxs)
4. **Health check**: `/api/health?quick=true` endpoint

### Next Steps When You Resume
1. Monitor the deployment for stability
2. Consider merging `build-fixes` into `main` once confirmed stable
3. Could optimize by using CDN for static assets if needed
4. Add tests for static asset serving

### Quick Test
To verify CSS is still working:
```bash
curl -I https://portfolio-ph867.ondigitalocean.app/_astro/customer-service.DDYOkrLK.css
```
Should return HTTP 200 with content-type: text/css
